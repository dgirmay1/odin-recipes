        <li>Total Time 35 mins</li>
        <br>
        <li>Servings 4 to 6</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups flavored instant oatmeal (from about 4 packets), such as Maple & Brown Sugar or Cinnamon & Spice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) cold salted butter, cut into 1 tablespoon-sized pieces, divided</li>
        <li>2 pounds apples (4 large or 5 medium), peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F:</li>
        <p>Arrange a rack in the center of the oven.</p>

        <li>Make the topping: </li>
        <p>
        Add the instant oatmeal to a medium bowl. Add 6 tablespoons of the butter and press and squeeze it into the 
        oats with your fingertips until moist crumbs form. Transfer to the refrigerator.
        </p>

        <li>Sauté the apples:</li>
        <p>
        Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in a 10-inch skillet (preferably oven-safe, like cast iron) over medium-high 
        heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized in spots and beginning to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. 
        (Reduce the heat to medium if the apples are browning too quickly.) Remove from the heat.
        </p>

        <li>Add the topping:</li>
        <p>
        If you’re not using an oven-safe skillet, transfer the apples to a 2-quart baking dish.
        <br>
        Scatter the topping over the apples. It likely won’t cover them entirely.
        </p>

        <li>Bake the crisp:</li>
        <p>
        Bake until the juices around the edges of the skillet are bubbling, the apples are tender, and the topping is golden-brown 
        and crisp, 18 to 24 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. 
        </p>
    </ol>

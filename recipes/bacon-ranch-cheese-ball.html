    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon:</li>

        Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until

        In a bowl spread out cream cheese and sprinkle ranch seasoning over the cheese. 
        Blend together until well combined.
        </p>

        <li>Mix bacon and dip:</li>
        <p>
        Chop bacon until it resembles fine crumbs. Reserve 2 tablespoons. Add remaining bacon to the cream 
        cheese mixture. Using clean (gloved) hands roll cream cheese mixture into a ball. Refrigerate for 
        30 minutes
        </p>

        <li>Refrigeration:</li>
        <p>
        Combine chopped pecans and reserved bacon in a small bowl. Cover cream cheese ball with pecan bacon 
        mixture. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Let come to room temperature about 30 minutes before serving.
